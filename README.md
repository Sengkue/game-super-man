# Superman vs Ghost Game

A fast-paced action game built with C++ and SFML where you play as Superman fighting against hordes of ghosts in a dynamic cityscape environment.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS

## Game Controls

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `W/A/S/D` or `Arrow Keys` | Superman movement/flying |
| `Spacebar` | Laser vision attack (ranged) |
| `Left Mouse Click` | Super punch attack (close combat) |
| `ESC` | Pause/Resume game |

```

2. **Create build directory**
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
```

3. **Configure with CMake**
```bash
# Debug build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..

# Release build (recommended for playing)
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
```

4. **Build the project**
```bash
# Windows (Visual Studio)
cmake --build . --config Release

# Linux/macOS
make -j$(nproc)
```

5. **Run the game**
```bash
# Windows
./Release/SupermanVsGhost.exe

# Linux/macOS
./SupermanVsGhost
```

### Option 2: Manual Compilation

#### Windows (MinGW)
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -I"path/to/SFML/include" -L"path/to/SFML/lib" *.cpp -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system -lsfml-audio -o SupermanVsGhost.exe
```

#### Linux
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 *.cpp -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system -lsfml-audio -o SupermanVsGhost
```

#### macOS
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 *.cpp -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system -lsfml-audio -o SupermanVsGhost
```

### Option 3: Visual Studio (Windows)

1. Open Visual Studio
2. Create a new C++ Console Application project
3. Add all `.cpp` and `.h` files to the project
4. Configure SFML:
   - Project Properties ‚Üí C/C++ ‚Üí Additional Include Directories: `path/to/SFML/include`
   - Project Properties ‚Üí Linker ‚Üí Additional Library Directories: `path/to/SFML/lib`
   - Project Properties ‚Üí Linker ‚Üí Additional Dependencies: Add:
     - `sfml-graphics.lib`
     - `sfml-window.lib` 
     - `sfml-system.lib`
     - `sfml-audio.lib`
5. Build and run

## Asset Requirements

The game can run without external assets by using procedurally generated graphics and silent audio. For enhanced experience, you can add:

### Textures (32x32 to 128x128 PNG files)
- `assets/textures/superman.png` - Superman sprite
- `assets/textures/ghost.png` - Ghost sprite  
- `assets/textures/background.png` - City background
- `assets/textures/effects.png` - Particle effects

### Audio (WAV or OGG files)
- `assets/sounds/laser.wav` - Laser attack sound
- `assets/sounds/punch.wav` - Punch attack sound
- `assets/sounds/ghost_death.wav` - Ghost defeat sound
- `assets/sounds/background_music.ogg` - Background music

### Fonts (TTF files)
- `assets/fonts/arial.ttf` - UI text font

## Performance Requirements

- **Minimum**: 2GB RAM, DirectX 9 compatible graphics
- **Recommended**: 4GB RAM, dedicated graphics card
- **Target Performance**: 60 FPS with 20+ entities on screen

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"SFML not found" during compilation**
- Install SFML development libraries
- Verify SFML path in CMake or compiler flags

**Game window doesn't open**
- Check graphics drivers are up to date
- Verify SFML runtime libraries are accessible

**No sound/audio**
- Install OpenAL runtime libraries
- Check audio device drivers

**Poor performance**
- Run in Release mode instead of Debug
- Close other applications
- Update graphics drivers

### Building Issues

**Windows: "Cannot find sfml-graphics-2.dll"**
```bash
# Copy SFML DLLs to executable directory
copy "SFML_PATH/bin/*.dll" "build/Release/"
```

**Linux: "error while loading shared libraries"**
```bash
# Install SFML runtime libraries
sudo apt install libsfml2.5

# Or add to LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

**macOS: Framework issues**
```bash
# Reinstall SFML via Homebrew
brew uninstall sfml
brew install sfml
```

## Development

### Code Style
- C++17 standard
- Object-oriented design with proper encapsulation
- RAII and smart pointers for memory management
- Frame-rate independent movement using delta time

### Adding Features
1. Implement new classes in separate `.h/.cpp` files
2. Add to CMakeLists.txt `SOURCES` and `HEADERS`
3. Follow existing patterns for game state management
4. Use ResourceManager for loading assets

### Debugging
- Build in Debug mode: `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..`
- Use debugger breakpoints in game loop
- Enable verbose logging in ResourceManager
